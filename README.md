# WeatherStation

##A CLI Weather Forcast app built entirely in Rust. 

##About.
This app was created, because I hate the Windows Weather App that comes pre-installed. So I made a better one that is easier on the eyes too.

##Usage
   1. Get an API KEY from Open Weather and use it in the api_key field
   2. Compile and run the code and enjoy the app.

#Note
By first startup the app will create a JSON file in the current directory.
